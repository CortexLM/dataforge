codenui/rrf.codenui.co.nz (#84): Refine site detail panel headings and site-type badge

Update the site detail panel to reduce redundant headings and visual clutter. Remove the extra “Details” heading and the licence/carrier count badges. Instead, show a single concise badge indicating the site type: display “Solo site” when there is exactly one carrier and “Shared site” when there is more than one.
