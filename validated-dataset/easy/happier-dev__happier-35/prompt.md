happier-dev/happier (#35): Fix CodeRabbit .coderabbit.yaml schema warnings

Update the CodeRabbit configuration to conform to the current schema and eliminate schema warnings. Ensure the review settings are organized under the correct sections, use the supported review status configuration, and remove any unsupported auto-approval configuration. The configuration should validate cleanly against the latest schema.
