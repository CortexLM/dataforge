alphagov/govuk-brand-guidelines (#323): Update homepage cards

This includes new colour icons to the homepage and creates cards for the 'Data' and 'Brand in use' sections.

It differs slightly from the design as the images are not full bleed to the card. This may need dev help.

## In Design
<img width="840" height="412" alt="Icon images are full bleed to the border of the associated card" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b28f750-e504-46a5-8130-d5d60c023d94" />
