alphagov/govuk-brand-guidelines (#323): Update homepage cards

Update the homepage card layout to include new color icons and add cards for the “Data” and “Brand in use” sections. Ensure the card visuals match the intended design, including icon images appearing full-bleed to the card edges without visible padding.
